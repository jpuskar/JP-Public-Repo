JP-Public-Repo
==============

This repository contains various projects from long ago. It's important to note that not all of the code is mine. Any scripts that were modified from someone else include a reference at the top. Any code used is also referenced.

Also, please note that these projects were published on Github with full manager approval. All services had been changed by the time any config leaks would have been deemed useful.

Thanks and enjoy your stay!
